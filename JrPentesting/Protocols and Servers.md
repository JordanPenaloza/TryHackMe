This room covered various protocols, their usage, and how they work under the hood. Many other standard protocols are of interest to attackers. For instance, Server Message Block (SMB) provides shared access to files and printers between networks, and it can be an exciting target. However, this room intends only to give you a good knowledge of a few common protocols and how they work under the hood. One room or even a complete module can’t cover all the network protocols.

It is good to remember the default port number for common protocols. Below is a summary of the protocols we covered, sorted in alphabetical order, along with their default port numbers.

|Protocol|TCP Port|Application(s)|Data Security|
|---|---|---|---|
|FTP|21|File Transfer|Cleartext|
|HTTP|80|Worldwide Web|Cleartext|
|IMAP|143|Email (MDA)|Cleartext|
|POP3|110|Email (MDA)|Cleartext|
|SMTP|25|Email (MTA)|Cleartext|
|Telnet|23|Remote Access|Cleartext|

In the next room of this module, we learn about various attacks against these protocols and servers along with mitigation steps.

It is good to remember the default port number for common protocols. For convenience, the services we covered are listed in the following table sorted by alphabetical order.

|Protocol|TCP Port|Application(s)|Data Security|
|---|---|---|---|
|FTP|21|File Transfer|Cleartext|
|FTPS|990|File Transfer|Encrypted|
|HTTP|80|Worldwide Web|Cleartext|
|HTTPS|443|Worldwide Web|Encrypted|
|IMAP|143|Email (MDA)|Cleartext|
|IMAPS|993|Email (MDA)|Encrypted|
|POP3|110|Email (MDA)|Cleartext|
|POP3S|995|Email (MDA)|Encrypted|
|SFTP|22|File Transfer|Encrypted|
|SSH|22|Remote Access and File Transfer|Encrypted|
|SMTP|25|Email (MTA)|Cleartext|
|SMTPS|465|Email (MTA)|Encrypted|
|Telnet|23|Remote Access|Cleartext|

Hydra remains a very efficient tool that you can launch from the terminal to try the different passwords. We summarize its main options in the following table.

|Option|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`-l username`|Provide the login name|
|`-P WordList.txt`|Specify the password list to use|
|`server service`|Set the server address and service to attack|
|`-s PORT`|Use in case of non-default service port number|
|`-V` or `-vV`|Show the username and password combinations being tried|
|`-d`|Display debugging output if the verbose output is not helping|
